        dct:description """Fuel poverty statistics report detailing Energy Efficiency and Dwelling Characteristics based on Median Fuel Costs, Income, FPEER Rating and Floor Area,
The Government is interested in the amount of energy households need to consume to have a warm, well-lit home, with hot water for everyday use, and the running of appliances. Therefore fuel poverty is measured based on required energy bills rather than actual spending. This ensures that those households who have low energy bills simply because they actively limit their use of energy at home, for example, by not heating their home are not overlooked. A methodology handbook has been published alongside this publication. This sets out the method for calculating the headline statistics using the LIHC indicator and the detailed methodology for calculating the income, energy efficiency and fuel prices for each household. It is available at:
