The Interim Levy Rate is set by LCCC every quarter, one quarter in advance, based on an estimate of the payments that will need to be made in respect of CfD generation in that quarter\nActual Income (\u00a3) :\tActual Income from electricity suppliers based on Actual Eligible Demand multiplied by Interim Levy Rate\nPeriod : The date on which energy is deemed to be used and must be later settled through BSC initial settlement/reconciliation or Scottish Settlements. Also known as the Trading Day\n",
    "description": "This dataset includes the determined Interim Levy Rates(ILR) and the actual daily Interim Levy Rate payments (ILR Income) received by LCCC from electricity suppliers.\nEnergy Intensive Industries (EII) are those industries that are determined by BEIS as intensive users of electricity. They are exempted from paying CfD levy, up to 85% of Supplier's daily gross demand.\nThis dataset is updated daily.",
